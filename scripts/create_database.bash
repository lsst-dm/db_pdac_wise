HELP="
DESCRIPTION:

  Create (or re-create) a new database configured in the environment
  configuration file:

    `realpath $SCRIPTS/../config/env.bash`

  This operation should be performed on MASTER or WORKER nodes of
  the Qserv cluster. Please, do not run this script directly! It's
  supposed to be launched by the corresponding 'driver' script:

    run_`basename $SCRIPT`

USAGE:

  `basename $SCRIPT` [<options>]

OPTIONS:

  -D|--delete
      force database deletion before attempting to create
      the new one.

      ATTENTION: this will destroy any data which were
                  previously loaded into the database."
